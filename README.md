#   Task 3 - Maven and other useful tools
    Convert your previous project to a maven project. 
    Add Sonar lint plugin support to your IDE.
    Add Editorconfig support to your project.
    In the future, all java projects should be created as maven projects. Every time before you a create merge request you should check your code with Sonar Lint. It wonâ€™t show all the problems but it can check a lot.
